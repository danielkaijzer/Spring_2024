    "## Problem: \n",
    "    we want to solve: How to take larger contexts in a manageable way. \n",
    "    We cannot just use tables like we did with bigrams (context of one char to predict next char) because they grow exponentially. \n",
    "## Solution:\n",
    "    We will use approach used in Bengio et al. paper. We will embed chars into a n dimensional vector space (a space smaller than number of chars which is 27). \n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this space related chars will be clustered together within the vector space, allowing us to generalize relationships so we can predict next chars in novel starting points.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    At first the embeddings will be random, i.e., the vectors representing chars will be placed randomly within the vector space. Then, using backpropagation in our multilayer neural network, we will change the locations of the vectors within the vector space so that chars that are often combined (in a context of n characters) are placed closely together.\n",

    "### What our neural network architecture looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "It will essentially consist of 3 main layers:\n",
    "1. An input layer\n",
    "    - where the size depends on: \n",
    "        1. n - the context length (how many chars we will use to predict next char)\n",
    "        2. m - the number of dimensions of the vector space we will use to embed chars (i.e., represent unique chars as a vector of m numbers).\n",
    "    - number of neurons in our input layer is n * m\n",
    "    - this first layer has linear neurons (i.e., neurons with no non-linearity) and their weight matrix is the LUT C (the embedding matrix). We are essentially encoding ints into one-hot, embedding them into the LUT, and then feeding the embedding LUT C into the next layer of our NN (which is 2. the hidden layer)\n",
    "2. A \"hidden layer\" that has a tanh non-linearity. This layer is fully connected to our input layer\n",
    "    - i.e., fully connected to the numbers representing the n chars used as inputs. So the n*m inputs will be fed into the tanh layer\n",
    "3. An output layer \n",
    "    - all neurons of output layer are fully connected to all neurons of tanh (non-linearity) layer\n",
    "    - will output a char chosen from the 27 possible number of chars. The chosen char will be the char with the highest probability based off of the previous n chars. And this probability will be tuned over several epochs to minimize a loss value (which measures the quality of our NN).\n",
    "        - Note: the loss will use negative log likelihood\n",
    "    - Most computation will be in this output layer. So this layer is the most performance expensive layer of our NN.\n",
    "    - This layer will have 27 logits, so this layer will have softmax layer on top of it. Everyone of these logits gets exponentiated and they are normalized so all logits sum to 1. This will then give us a useful probability distribution for the next char in the sequence.\n",
    "        - During training we will have labels (the identity of the correct next char in the sequence). That char (represented as an int index) will be used to pluck out the probability of that char. The NN will be trained, i.e., the parameters of our NN will be tuned, to maximize the probability of that char (given the n previous chars in the sequence). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: These parameters of our NN are the weights and biases of the output layer and our hidden layer, as well as the embedding LUT (C) within our input layer. All these parameters are optimized using backprop.\n",
